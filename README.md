# Realtime 3D Rendering with JavaScript and GLSL

## Overview
The Realtime 3D Rendering project is developed using JavaScript and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) to create interactive and dynamic 3D graphics in real-time. By combining the power of JavaScript for logic and GLSL for shader programming, this project enables users to render immersive and visually stunning 3D scenes directly in their web browser. The objective of this project is to provide a framework for creating interactive and high-performance 3D graphics applications.

## Features
- Real-time rendering of 3D scenes using JavaScript and GLSL.
- Support for complex shader effects and advanced lighting models.
- Dynamic and interactive user-controlled camera movement.
- Integration with input devices for user interaction (e.g., mouse, keyboard, gamepad).
- Effortless integration with HTML5 Canvas or WebGL for rendering.

## Requirements
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support
- HTML5 Canvas or WebGL support in the browser
- JavaScript libraries/frameworks

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Set up a local web server or use a web hosting service to serve the project files.
3. Open the application in a web browser that supports JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas or WebGL.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the real-time 3D rendering application.
5. Use input devices (e.g., mouse, keyboard, gamepad) to control the camera or trigger other interactions.
